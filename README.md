![Colour Palette](readme_assets/c3ds_palette.png)

<br>

### **Typography**

Typography was also chosen to be in keeping with the brand identity of the University of Exeter and so Outfit Font was used for the majority of the text throughout.


<br>

### **Wireframes**

## Database and Logic

Careful consideration was taken in the planning stages of this project. Initial user journeys were mapped out for both the admin and general user. From these an ER Diagram was created.

<br>

### **Accessibility**
In addition to being best practice, having an accessible website is extremely high on the list of requirements for the target audience. Close attention has been paid to the following in order to ensure the site is as accessible as possible:
- Clear and simple font styling, avoiding any cursive or calligraphic scripts.
- Contrasting colour scheme
- Use of semantic HTML
- Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded. Also ensuring that these are as descriptive as possible.

<br>

### **Future Features**
In the future there are features and developments that it would be useful to consider adding to create an even better user experience of this website. They include:

- A user login platform where researchers/partners can complete a form to upload publications

## Deployment

At the time of writing (3rd November 2023), this project is deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Below are the steps taken.
### Setup
#### Prepare your IDE
1. Install dj_database_url and psycopg2
```
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
```
2. At this point if using Cloudinary you can install now
```
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
```
3. Create your requirements.txt file
```
pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt
```
4. Create your Django project
```
django-admin startproject myprojectname .
```
5. Create your first project app
```
python3 manage.py startapp myappname
```
6. Add your new app to installed apps in your project settings.py
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'myappname',
]
```
7. Ensure all files are saved
8. Migrate
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

### Database Setup

1. Visit [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/login)
2. Select 'Create New Instance'
3. Give your new plan a name
4. Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan - (leave tag fields blank)
5. Select region
6. Review and 'Create Instance'
7. From the dashboard click on your new instance's name
8. Copy the URL

### Deployment
#### Prepare Heroku

1. Visit [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
2. Select 'New' and 'Create New App'
3. Name the app
4. Select region and 'Creatre App'

#### env.py file

1. Create a new file called 'env.py' in the root directory of your project
2. Add the following code:
```
import os

os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'paste_url_from_elephantsql_here'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'create_a_secret_key_here'
```

#### settings.py
1. At the top of settings.py just below the Path import, add the following code:
```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```
2. Remove the SECRET_KEY that is in settings and replace with:
```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```
3. Comment out the original DATABASES variable and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
4. Migrate
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

#### If using Cloudinary
1. Visit [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/login) and set up account
2. Copy API environment variable
3. In env.py add:
```
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'your_cloudinary_api' 
```
4. In settings.py add cloudinary_storage and cloudinary to installed apps
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    'myappname',
]
```
5. Near the end of settings.py add:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')


MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'

```

#### Heroku Config Vars
1. Go to your Heroku Dashboard
2. Go to your app and select 'Settings'
3. Click 'Add config vars'
4. Enter the following:
```
DATABASE_URL : your_elephantsql_url
SECRET_KEY : your_secret_key
PORT: 8000
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC : 1
CLOUDINARY_URL : your_cloudinary_url
```

#### Templates
1. In settings.py, find BASE_DIR amd add:
```
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
```
2. Midway down your settings.py file change the DIRS to:
```
[TEMPLATES_DIR]

```
web: gunicorn myprojectname.wsgi
```

### Deployment
1. Go to Heroku
2. Open your app and select 'Deploy'
3. Select Github as the deployment method
4. Find the correct repository and connect
5. Deploy Branch

When you deploy it is vital that you do not have DEBUG set to True. To overcome this while simultaneously working in the IDE and being deployed you can:
1. In settings.py replace DEBUG=True with:
```
DEBUG = 'DEBUG' in os.environ
```
2. In your env.py file add:
```
os.environ['DEBUG'] = '1'
```

### Create a Superuser
1. In the terminal of your IDE type the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
2. Follow the terminal instructions to set up a password

2. Go to the repository page for [c3ds](https://github.com/llewellynksj/c3ds) - (You can also use the search bar)
3. Select 'Fork' at the top right of the page

### Clone

1. Follow the first 2 steps to Fork
2. Select 'Code' dropdown and choose the clone option your require
